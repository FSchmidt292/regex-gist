# Regex Breakdown

This is my challenge for week 17, interpretting a line of Regex code and breaking it down, explaining exactly what the piece of code is checking against. I will breakdown portions of a regex line and explain each piece of the code to demonstrate an understanding of what is going on with the code.

## Summary

I have selected to breakdown the regex for matching a hex value. This is the code snippet:

"/^#?([a-f0-9]{6}|[a-f0-9]{3})$/"

I will be breaking down each individual element here and also explaining what the specific fields are looking for (ex, entire alphabet or just a portion of the alphabet).
